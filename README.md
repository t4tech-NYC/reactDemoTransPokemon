## Hello :)

This is the t4tech React demo application that interacts with the free Pokemon API server. Feel free to fork, clone, and hack!

This was bootstrapped with create-react-app. When you clone the repo, navigate into the directory and from your terminal run the command

`yarn install`

which will install the necessary dependencies. Then run

`yarn start`

which will boot the server from port 3000 and launch in your browser. Keep in mind there are two branches! The master branch is the fully functional version, which will contain every feature we want to add and keep to the app. Feel free to make your own features and submit a pull request to make it a part of the app! The 'starter' branch of the app is a barebones boilerplate for if you want to mimic the behavior from the master branch but implement everything on your own. Remember, the best way to learn is to do.
